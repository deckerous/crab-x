- Made the rally crab distinct from other crabs.
- Added arrow keys for movement and 'space' for shoot as alternative controls.
- Added drop shadows to crabs, sandfleas, and seagulls.
- Stopped seagulls from being able to see you through walls.
- Improved sandflea ability to pathfind around corners.
- IN PROGRESS: Made crabs be influenced partially by the rally point's move input direction for better strafing.
